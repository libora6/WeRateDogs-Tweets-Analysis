# WeRateDogs-Tweets-Analysis
Applying Data Wrangling techniques on the WeRateDogs tweets data base

WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that classify and rates pictures of dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. 
My goal here is to perform a data wrangling process (Gather, Assess, Cleaning) using 3 sources of data (listed below), 
analyze and visualize the data after the wrangling process to report any interesting findings.

1) WeRateDogs Twitter's archive (was sent by WeRateDogs to Udacity, which provided it to this project)
2) Tweet image predicitions of dog's breeds on each tweet resulted from a neural network - sourced on Udacity's server
3) Retweet count and favorite count for each WeRateDogs' tweet, queried on a Twitter API
